4. Performance Dashboard
Displays four critical metrics:

Safety Score: 95.8 (based on studies showing injury crash reductions of 72-80%) BioCycleIIHS
CO₂ Savings: 32% reduction (modern roundabouts can reduce CO₂ emissions by 21-34%) BioCycleOMICS International
Wait Time Reduction: 48% (studies show 52-65% average reduction in vehicle stops) IIHS
Throughput: Live vehicle count per hour

5. Design Configuration Options
Three intersection designs to test:

Modern Roundabout (Default)

Continuous flow, saves 20,000 gallons of fuel annually BioCycle
Best for medium traffic volumes
32% CO₂ reduction


Shared Space

Low-speed pedestrian-priority zone
Ideal for urban/community areas
Highest safety score (97.2)


Adaptive AI Managed

V2X-based vehicle negotiation for autonomous vehicles NCBIMDPI
Dynamic priority allocation
Highest efficiency (58% wait reduction)



6. AI Traffic Pattern Analysis
Based on real traffic studies:

Peak flow identification
Turning ratio analysis (60% through, 25% left, 15% right)
Pedestrian demand tracking
Conflict point reduction (8 → 2 with roundabout)

7. Sustainability Features

✓ Solar-powered sensor beacons (100% renewable)
✓ Permeable pavement (40% stormwater reduction)
✓ Green corridors with native vegetation
✓ Zero idling time
✓ Protected cycling infrastructure

8. Community Engagement Plan
Three-phase approach:

Phase 1: Community surveys and public meetings
Phase 2: 6-month pilot with temporary infrastructure
Phase 3: Permanent deployment with public dashboard
Success metric: Public acceptance increases from 31% to 70% after one year BioCycle

🔧 Technical Implementation:
The prototype uses:

V2X Communication Simulation: Vehicle-to-Everything communication enables real-time data exchange for cooperative perception and decision-making NCBIarXiv
Priority-based Negotiation: FIFO-based (First-In-First-Out) right-of-way assignment with dynamic resequencing ScienceDirect
Real-time Metrics: Live updates of traffic flow, emissions, and safety scores
Interactive Controls: Test different scenarios, add emergency vehicles, adjust priorities

🌍 Cost-Effective & Sustainable Design:

No electrical infrastructure for traffic lights
Grid-independent operation during power outages BioCycle
Minimal maintenance compared to signal systems
Sensor beacon poles instead of traditional signal hardware
Each roundabout eliminates 189 metric tons of CO₂e emissions annually B
